# MNIST_Clothes_Classification: 
In this assignment, MNIST dataset, which includes 28x28 images of clothes that contains 10
classes, and 70.000 instances of the clothes are used to make predictions for their labels with
five different classification algorithms, which are K-Nearest Neighbors, Perceptron, SVM,
Decision Tree and Random Forest. Sklearn library is used for implementing algorithms,
accuracy and matrix calculations. NumPy is used for mathematical calculations and array.
Pandas is used to read dataset and create a table. Seaborn library is also imported to use its
heatmap object for matrix plotting. Matplotlib is imported to visualize the images by their
pixels. PCA is implemented to find the number of components to explain the 25%, 50%, 75%
and 95% of the variance of the dataset. Training and testing processes were repeated for each
algorithm with reduced data to compare their accuracies after dimensional reduction.
